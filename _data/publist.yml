#- title: "Direct evidence for Cooper pairing without a spectral gap in a disordered superconductor above Tc"
#  image: Pairs3.png
#  description: We use our atomic-scale scanning tunneling noise setup on a disordered superconductor, and discover a state above TC that, much like an ordinary metal, has no (pseudo)gap, but carries charge via paired electrons.

- title: "A survey on datasets for fairness-aware machine learning"
  image: fairdata-survey.png
  description: We overview real-world datasets used for fairness-aware machine learning. We focus on tabular data as the most common data representation for fairness-aware machine learning. We start our analysis by identifying relationships between the different attributes, particularly w.r.t. protected attributes and class attribute, using a Bayesian network. For a deeper understanding of bias in the datasets, we investigate the interesting relationships using exploratory analysis.

- title: "Interpretable Visual Understanding with Cognitive Attention Network"
  image: Xuejiao2021.png
  description: we propose a novel Cognitive Attention Network (CAN) for visual commonsense reasoning to achieve interpretable visual understanding. Specifically, we first introduce an image-text fusion module to fuse Information from images and text collectively. Second, a novel inference module is designed to encode commonsense among image, query and response. Extensive experiment on large-scale Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

- title: "XPROAX-Local explanations for text classification with progressive neighborhood approximation"
  image: 
  description: The importance of the neighborhood for training a local surrogate model to approximate the local decision boundary of a black box classifier has been already highlighted in the literature. Several attempts have been made to construct a better neighborhood for high dimensional data, like texts, by using generative autoencoders. However, existing approaches mainly generate neighbors by selecting purely at random from the latent space and struggle under the curse of dimensionality to learn a good local decision boundary.
