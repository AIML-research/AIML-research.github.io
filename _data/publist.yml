- title: "AdaCC cumulative cost-sensitive boosting for imbalanced classification"
  image: 
  description: Class imbalance poses a major challenge for machine learning as most supervised learning models might exhibit bias towards the majority class and under-perform in the minority class. Cost-sensitive learning tackles this problem by treating the classes differently, formulated typically via a user-defined fixed misclassification cost matrix provided as input to the learner. Such parameter tuning is a challenging task that requires domain knowledge and moreover, wrong adjustments might lead to overall predictive performance deterioration. In this work, we propose a novel cost-sensitive boosting approach for imbalanced data that dynamically adjusts the misclassification costs over the boosting rounds in response to model’s performance instead of using a fixed misclassification cost matrix. Our method, called AdaCC, is parameter-free as it relies on the cumulative behavior of the boosting model in order to adjust the misclassification costs for the next boosting round and comes with theoretical guarantees regarding the training error. Experiments on 27 real-world datasets from different domains with high class imbalance demonstrate the superiority of our method over 12 state-of-the-art cost-sensitive boosting approaches exhibiting consistent improvements in different measures, for instance, AUC, balanced accuracy, gmean and recall.

  description:  Bias in CV is a hard problem. In this survey we focus on i) selection, 2)framing and 3)label bias and overview existing research for bias detection and mitigation. Main conclusions i) Most approaches reduce the problem to tabular data and do not necessarily capture the complexity of visual data. ii) There exist no bias free dataset but only attempts for bias-aware dataset collection w.r.t. specific protected attributes. iii) Those working with visual data should be aware of the biases in their data – we provide a checklist that might help to spot biases during the data collection process. iv) the problem of bias discovery and quantification is open in terms of both methods and the range of biases that can be detected.

- title: "Multi-fairness under class-imbalance"
  image: 
  description:  Recent studies showed that datasets used in fairness-aware machine learning for multiple protected attributes (referred to as multidiscrimination hereafter) are often imbalanced. The class-imbalance problem is more severe for the protected group in the critical minority class (e.g., female +, non-white +, etc.). Still, existing methods focus only on the overall error-discrimination trade-off, ignoring the imbalance problem, and thus they amplify the prevalent bias in the minority classes. To solve the combined problem of multi-discrimination and class-imbalance we introduce a new fairness measure, Multi-Max Mistreatment (MMM ),which considers both (multi-attribute) protected group and class membership of instances to measure discrimination. To solve the combined problem, we propose Multi-Fair Boosting Post Pareto (MFBPP) a boosting approach that incorporates MMM -costs in the distribution update and post-training, selects the optimal trade-off among accurate, classbalanced, and fair solutions. The experimental results show the superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art methods in producing the best balanced performance across groups and classes and the best accuracy for the protected groups in the minority class..

  description: This is an extension of our <a href = "https://aiml-research.github.io/files/19.CIKM.pdf"> AdaFair </a> algorithm (CIKM 2019) to other parity-based fairness notions (<a href = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.01148v1.pdf">arXiv version</a>). We propose an ensemble approach to fairness that alters the data distribution over the boosting rounds "forcing" the model to pay more attention to misclassified instances of the minority. This is done using the so-called fairness cost which assesses performance differences between the protected and non-protected groups. It is evaluated based on the partial ensemble rather than on the weak model of each boosting round.

  image: 
  description: Many current and future applications plan to provide entity-specific predictions. These range from individualized healthcare applications to user-specific purchase recommendations. In our previous stream-based work on Amazon review data, we could show that error-weighted ensembles that combine entity-centric classifiers, which are only trained on reviews of one particular product (entity), and entity-ignorant classifiers, which are trained on all reviews irrespective of the product, can improve prediction quality. This came to the cost of storing multiple entity-centric models in primary memory, many of which would never be used again as their entities would not receive future instances in the stream. To overcome this drawback and make entity-centric learning viable in these scenarios, we investigated two different methods of reducing the primary memory requirement of our entity-centric approach.

- title: "Active feature acquisition on data streams under feature drift"
  image: 
  description: Traditional active learning tries to identify instances for which the acquisition of the label increases model performance under budget constraints. Less research has been devoted to the task of actively acquiring feature values, whereupon both the instance and the feature must be selected intelligently and even less to a scenario where the instances arrive in a stream with feature drift. We propose an active feature acquisition strategy for data streams with feature drift, as well as an active feature acquisition evaluation framework. We also implement a baseline that chooses features randomly and compare the random approach against eight different methods in a scenario where we can acquire at most one feature at the time per instance and where all features are considered to cost the same.

- title: "Taxi Demand Prediction using an LSTM-Based Deep Sequence Model and Points of Interest"
  image: 
  description: In this paper, an LSTM-based deep sequence learning model is applied to forecast taxi-demand in a particular urban area in a smart city. For this purpose, points of interest (POIs) in the city are extracted from Google Maps and integrated with the mobility data sources. Given a real-world dataset and two evaluation metrics, we observed that taxi-demand in each urban area can be influenced by external factors such as neighborhood locations and the POIs located in that area.

  image: NoBIAS.Survey@WIREs2020.png
  description: In this survey, we focus on data-driven AI, as a large part of AI is powered nowadays by (big) data and powerful machine learning algorithms. If otherwise not specified, we use the general term bias to describe problems related to the gathering or processing of data that might result in prejudiced decisions on the bases of demographic features such as race, sex, and so forth.

- title: "FAE: A Fairness-Aware Ensemble Framework"
  image: Vasilis2019.png
  description: The proposed FAE (Fairness-Aware Ensemble) framework combines fairness-related interventions at both pre-and post-processing steps of the data analysis process. In the pre-processing step, we tackle the problems of under-representation of the protected group (group imbalance) and of class-imbalance by generating balanced training samples. In the post-processing step, we tackle the problem of class overlapping by shifting the decision boundary in the direction of fairness.

- title: "Active Feature Acquisition For Opinion Stream Classification Under Drift"
  image: 
  description: Active stream learning is frequently used to acquire labels for instances and less frequently to determine which features should be considered as the stream evolves. We introduce a framework for active feature selection, intended to adapt the feature space of a polarity learner over a stream of opinionated documents. We report on the first results of our framework on substreams of reviews on different product categories.

- title: "A Neighborhood-augmented LSTM Model forTaxi-Passenger Demand Prediction"
  image: 
  description: In this paper, we propose an approach for predicting the pick-demand of a given taxi-stand, that takes into account not only the demand-history of the particular stand but it also considers information from neighboring stands. Our model is an LSTM neural network augmented with information from the spatial neighborhood of the stands. Experiments with two versions of the taxi demand dataset from the city of Porto, Portugal show that our approach can provide better predictions comparing to approaches that do not exploit the neighborhood.

- title: "Fairness-Enhancing Interventions in Stream Classification"
  image: Vasilis2019DEXA.png
  description: Existing fairness-aware approaches tackle fairness as a batch learning problem and aim at learning a fair model which can then be applied to future instances of the problem. In many applications, however, the data comes sequentially and its characteristics might evolve with time. In such a setting, it is counter-intuitive to “fix” a (fair) model over the data stream as changes in the data might incur changes in the underlying model therefore, affecting its fairness. We propose fairness-enhancing interventions that modify the input data so that the outcome of any stream classifier applied to that data will be fair.

  description: In this paper, we introduce a learning mechanism to design a fair classifier for online stream based decision-making. Our learning model, FAHT (Fairness-Aware Hoeffding Tree), is an extension of the well-known Hoeffding Tree algorithm for decision tree induction over streams, that also accounts for fairness. Our experiments show that our algorithm is able to deal with discrimination in streaming environments, while maintaining a moderate predictive performance over the stream.

- title: "Exploiting entity information for stream classification over a stream of reviews"
  image: 
  description: Opinion stream classification algorithms adapt the model to the arriving review texts and, depending on the forgetting scheme, reduce the contribution old reviews have upon the model. Reviews are assumed independent, and information on the entity to which a review refers, i.e. to the opinion target, is thereby ignored. This implies that the prediction of a review's label is based more on reviews referring to other, more popular or simply more recently inspected entities, while reviews referring to the same entity might be ignored as too old. In this study, we enforce that the reviews to each entity are taken into account for learning, adaption and forgetting.

Moreover, the use of reinforcement learning naturally enables additional functionality such as learning under concept drifts, feature importance weighting, inclusion of new features and forgetting of obsolete ones as well as classification with incomplete data.

- title: "Redundancies in Data and their Effect on the Evaluation of Recommendation Systems: A Case Study on the Amazon Reviews Datasets"
  image: 
  description:  We analyze the nature and amount of these redundancies and their impact on the evaluation of recommendation methods. While the general and obvious conclusion is that redundancies should be avoided and datasets should be carefully preprocessed, we observe more specifically that their impact depends on the complexity of the methods. With this work, we also want to raise the awareness of the importance of data quality, model understanding, and appropriate evaluation.

- title: "The Isotopic Fingerprint: New Methods of Data Mining and Similarity Search"
  image: 
  description:  We propose a new method for feature selection and apply it to a sample dataset of animal bones from the reference region. This application confirms that a multivariate fingerprint is clearly superior over univariate analysis and that the impact of oxygen on the reliability of the fingerprints is not very prominent. These findings confirm that it is possible to explore cremated human material for provenance analysis

- title: "Density-based Projected Clustering over High Dimensional Data Streams"

  description:  We propose a new density-based projected clustering algorithm, HDDSTREAM, for high dimensional data streams. Our algorithm summarizes both the data points and the dimensions where these points are grouped together and maintains these summaries online, as new points arrive over time and old points expire due to ageing. Our experimental results illustrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of HDDSTREAM and also demonstrate that it could serve as a trigger for detecting drastic changes in the underlying stream population, like bursts of network attacks

We enhance recommendations with the notion of support to model the confidence of the recommendations. Moreover, we propose partitioning users into clusters of similar ones. This way, recommendations for users are produced with respect to the preferences of their cluster members without extensively searching for similar users in the whole user base. Finally, we leverage the power of a top-k algorithm for locating the top-k group recommendations.

- title: "Fast Group Recommendations by Applying User Clustering"
  image: 
  description:  In this paper, we propose an extensive model for group recommendations that exploits recommendations for items that similar users to the group members liked in the past. We do not exhaustively search for similar users in the whole user base, but we pre-partition users into clusters of similar ones and use the cluster members for recommendations. We efficiently aggregate the single user recommendations into group recommendations by leveraging the power of a top-k algorithm. We evaluate our approach in a real dataset of movie ratings.

  image: 
  description:  Decision trees are among the most popular pattern types in data mining due to their intuitive representation. However, little attention has been given on the definition of measures of semantic similarity between decision trees. In this work, we present a general framework for similarity estimation that includes as special cases the estimation of semantic similarity between decision trees, as well as various forms of similarity estimation on classification datasets with respect to different probability distributions defined over the attribute-class space of the datasets. The similarity estimation is based on the partitions induced by the decision trees on the attribute space of the datasets.
