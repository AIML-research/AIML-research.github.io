- title: "A survey on datasets for fairness-aware machine learning"
  image: fairdata-survey.png
  description: We overview real-world datasets used for fairness-aware machine learning. We focus on tabular data as the most common data representation for fairness-aware machine learning. We start our analysis by identifying relationships between the different attributes, particularly w.r.t. protected attributes and class attribute, using a Bayesian network. For a deeper understanding of bias in the datasets, we investigate the interesting relationships using exploratory analysis.

  image: Xuejiao2021.png
  description: we propose a novel Cognitive Attention Network (CAN) for visual commonsense reasoning to achieve interpretable visual understanding. Specifically, we first introduce an image-text fusion module to fuse Information from images and text collectively. Second, a novel inference module is designed to encode commonsense among image, query and response. Extensive experiment on large-scale Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

  description: The importance of the neighborhood for training a local surrogate model to approximate the local decision boundary of a black box classifier has been already highlighted in the literature. Several attempts have been made to construct a better neighborhood for high dimensional data, like texts, by using generative autoencoders. However, existing approaches mainly generate neighbors by selecting purely at random from the latent space and struggle under the curse of dimensionality to learn a good local decision boundary.

  image: Taifair2021.png
  description: We introduce the fair-capacitated clustering problem that partitions the data into clusters of similar instances while ensuring cluster fairness and balancing cluster cardinalities. We propose a two-step solution to the problem, i) we rely on fairlets to generate minimal sets that satisfy the fair constraint and ii) we propose two approaches, namely hierarchical clustering and partitioning-based clustering, to obtain the fair-capacitated clustering. The hierarchical approach embeds the additional cardinality requirements during the merging step while the partitioning-based one alters the assignment step using a knapsack problem formulation to satisfy the additional requirements.

  description: We propose a model-agnostic method for sequential counterfactual generation. We formulate the task as a multi-objective optimization problem and present a genetic algorithm approach to find optimal sequences of actions leading to the counterfactuals. Our cost model considers not only the direct effect of an action, but also its consequences. Experimental results show that compared to state-of-the-art, our approach generates less costly solutions, is more efficient and provides the user with a diverse set of solutions to choose from.

Our approach optimizes a multi-objective loss function which (a) learns a fair representation by suppressing protected attributes (b) maintains the information content by minimizing the reconstruction loss and (c) allows for solving a classification task in a fair manner by minimizing the classification error and respecting the equalized odds-based fairness regularizer.

  description: We propose FABBOO, an online fairness-aware approach that maintains a valid and fair classifier over a stream. FABBOO is an online boosting approach that changes the training distribution in an online Fashion based on both stream imbalance and discriminatory behavior of the model evaluated over the historical stream. Our experiments show that such long-termin consideration of class-imbalance and fairness are beneficial for maintaining models that exhibit good predictive- and fairness-related performance.

  description: We propose the Drift-Aware Multi-Memory Model (DAM3), which addresses the class imbalance problem in online learning for memory-based models, namely KNNs. DAM3 mitigates class imbalance by incorporating an imbalance-sensitive drift detector, preserving a balanced representation of classes in the model, and resolving retroactive interference using a working memory that prevents the forgetting of old information. We show through experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets that the proposed method mitigates class imbalance and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

  image: 
  description: Many current and future applications plan to provide entity-specific predictions. These range from individualized healthcare applications to user-specific purchase recommendations. In our previous stream-based work on Amazon review data, we could show that error-weighted ensembles that combine entity-centric classifiers, which are only trained on reviews of one particular product (entity), and entity-ignorant classifiers, which are trained on all reviews irrespective of the product, can improve prediction quality. This came to the cost of storing multiple entity-centric models in primary memory, many of which would never be used again as their entities would not receive future instances in the stream. To overcome this drawback and make entity-centric learning viable in these scenarios, we investigated two different methods of reducing the primary memory requirement of our entity-centric approach.

  image: 
  description: Traditional active learning tries to identify instances for which the acquisition of the label increases model performance under budget constraints. Less research has been devoted to the task of actively acquiring feature values, whereupon both the instance and the feature must be selected intelligently and even less to a scenario where the instances arrive in a stream with feature drift. We propose an active feature acquisition strategy for data streams with feature drift, as well as an active feature acquisition evaluation framework. We also implement a baseline that chooses features randomly and compare the random approach against eight different methods in a scenario where we can acquire at most one feature at the time per instance and where all features are considered to cost the same.

  description: In this paper, an LSTM-based deep sequence learning model is applied to forecast taxi-demand in a particular urban area in a smart city. For this purpose, points of interest (POIs) in the city are extracted from Google Maps and integrated with the mobility data sources. Given a real-world dataset and two evaluation metrics, we observed that taxi-demand in each urban area can be influenced by external factors such as neighborhood locations and the POIs located in that area.

All the enormous benefits that the Web offers - for Information sharing, collective organization and distributed activity, social inclusion and economic growth - will always carry along negative consequences, too, and 30 years after ist creation negative consequnces of the Web are only too apparent. The Web continues to evolve and ist next major step will involve Artificial Intelligence (AI) at large. AI has the potential to amplify positive and negative outcomes, and we explore these possibilities, situating them within the wider debate about the future of regulation and governance for the Web. Finally, we outline the need to extend Web Science as the science that is devoted to the Analysis and Engineering of the Web, to strengthen our role in shaping the future of the Web and present five key directions for capacity building that are necessary to achieve this (i), supporting interdisciplinarity, (ii), supporting collaboration, (iii), supporting the sustainable Web, (iv), supporting the Intelligent Web and (v), supporting the Inclusive Web. Our writing reflects our background in several disciplines of the social and technical sciences and that these disciplines emphasize topics to various extents. We are acutely aware that our observations occupy a particular point in time and are skewed towards our experience as Western scholars - a limitation that Web Science will need to overcome.

In the pre-processing step, we tackle the problems of under-representation of the protected group (group imbalance) and of class-imbalance by generating balanced training samples. In the post-processing step, we tackle the problem of class overlapping by shifting the decision boundary in the direction of fairness.
