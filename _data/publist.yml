- title: "A survey on datasets for fairness-aware machine learning"
  image: fairdata-survey.png
  description: We overview real-world datasets used for fairness-aware machine learning. We focus on tabular data as the most common data representation for fairness-aware machine learning. We start our analysis by identifying relationships between the different attributes, particularly w.r.t. protected attributes and class attribute, using a Bayesian network. For a deeper understanding of bias in the datasets, we investigate the interesting relationships using exploratory analysis.

- title: "Interpretable Visual Understanding with Cognitive Attention Network"
  image: Xuejiao2021.png
  description: we propose a novel Cognitive Attention Network (CAN) for visual commonsense reasoning to achieve interpretable visual understanding. Specifically, we first introduce an image-text fusion module to fuse Information from images and text collectively. Second, a novel inference module is designed to encode commonsense among image, query and response. Extensive experiment on large-scale Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

  image: 
  description: The importance of the neighborhood for training a local surrogate model to approximate the local decision boundary of a black box classifier has been already highlighted in the literature. Several attempts have been made to construct a better neighborhood for high dimensional data, like texts, by using generative autoencoders. However, existing approaches mainly generate neighbors by selecting purely at random from the latent space and struggle under the curse of dimensionality to learn a good local decision boundary.

- title: "Fair-Capacitated Clustering"
  image: Taifair2021.png
  description: We introduce the fair-capacitated clustering problem that partitions the data into clusters of similar instances while ensuring cluster fairness and balancing cluster cardinalities. We propose a two-step solution to the problem, i) we rely on fairlets to generate minimal sets that satisfy the fair constraint and ii) we propose two approaches, namely hierarchical clustering and partitioning-based clustering, to obtain the fair-capacitated clustering. The hierarchical approach embeds the additional cardinality requirements during the merging step while the partitioning-based one alters the assignment step using a knapsack problem formulation to satisfy the additional requirements.

- title: "Consequence-aware Sequential Counterfactual Generation"
  image: Philip2021.png
  description: We propose a model-agnostic method for sequential counterfactual generation. We formulate the task as a multi-objective optimization problem and present a genetic algorithm approach to find optimal sequences of actions leading to the counterfactuals. Our cost model considers not only the direct effect of an action, but also its consequences. Experimental results show that compared to state-of-the-art, our approach generates less costly solutions, is more efficient and provides the user with a diverse set of solutions to choose from.

  description: We revisited the origins of Web Science, explored that challenges and opportunities of the Web, and looked ahead to potential futures for both the Web and Web Science. We explain issues that society faces in the Web by the ambivalences that are inherent in the Web. All the enormous benefits that the Web offers - for Information sharing, collective organization and distributed activity, social inclusion and economic growth - will always carry along negative consequences, too, and 30 years after ist creation negative consequnces of the Web are only too apparent.

  description: We propose "FairNN" a neural network that performs joint feature representation and classification for fairness-aware learning. Our approach optimizes a multi-objective loss function which (a) learns a fair representation by suppressing protected attributes (b) maintains the information content by minimizing the reconstruction loss and (c) allows for solving a classification task in a fair manner by minimizing the classification error and respecting the equalized odds-based fairness regularizer.

  description: We propose FABBOO, an online fairness-aware approach that maintains a valid and fair classifier over a stream. FABBOO is an online boosting approach that changes the training distribution in an online Fashion based on both stream imbalance and discriminatory behavior of the model evaluated over the historical stream. Our experiments show that such long-termin consideration of class-imbalance and fairness are beneficial for maintaining models that exhibit good predictive- and fairness-related performance.

  image: Amir2020.png
  description: We propose the Drift-Aware Multi-Memory Model (DAM3), which addresses the class imbalance problem in online learning for memory-based models, namely KNNs. DAM3 mitigates class imbalance by incorporating an imbalance-sensitive drift detector, preserving a balanced representation of classes in the model, and resolving retroactive interference using a working memory that prevents the forgetting of old information. We show through experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets that the proposed method mitigates class imbalance and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
