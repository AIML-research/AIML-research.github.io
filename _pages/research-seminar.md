## Reseach seminar
This is the research seminar by the AIML group. Most sessions take place in forms of a reading group or a research presentation by some member of the group or external guest. For the reading sessions: everybody reads the assigned paper before the meeting. Then we jointly discuss the paper (the main idea, experiments, pros and cons etc.).
