<p>I am a <em>Full Professor for Open Source Intelligence</em> at the <a href="https://www.unibw.de/inf" target="_new">Faculty of Computer Science</a>, University of the Bundeswehr Munich (<a href="https://www.unibw.de/" target="_new">UniBwM</a>) and the Research Institute <a href="https://www.unibw.de/code" target="_new">CODE</a>. Previously, I was a <em>Full Professor of Artificial Intelligence</em> at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Free University of Berlin (<a href="https://www.fu-berlin.de/" target="_new">FUB</a>) and an <em>Associate Professor of Intelligent Systems</em> at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Leibniz University Hannover (<a href="https://www.uni-hannover.de/en/" target="_new">LUH</a>), and I remains a member of the <a href="https://www.l3s.de/" target="_new">L3S</a> Research Center today. I also held a postdoctoral position at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (<a href="" target="_new">LMU</a>). I obtained my Ph.D. from the University of Piraeus (<a href="http://unipi.gr/" target="_new">UniPi</a>), Athens, and holds an M.Sc. and a Diploma in Computer Engineering and Informatics from the University of Patras (<a href="https://www.upatras.gr/" target="_new">UPatras</a>), Greece.</p>

<p>I specialize in developing intelligent algorithms to tackle <em>real-world challenges</em> like <em>non-stationarity</em>, <em>imbalances</em>, and <em>data scarcity</em>. Committed to <em>responsible AI</em> progress, I focus on understanding the capabilities and limitations of AI systems by addressing <em>bias and discrimination</em>, enhancing transparency through <em>explainable AI</em>, and strengthening the <em>resilience</em> and <em>robustness</em> of AI/ML models.</p>

My ultimate goal? <strong><em>Creating intelligent systems that augment human intelligence and benefit society</em></strong>.

#### Research Interests
<ul>
  <li>Responsible AI (Fairness, Explainability, Bias Mitigation)</li>
  <li>Adaptive AI</li>
  <li>Data Stream Learning</li>
  <li>Resilient & Robust AI</li>
  <li>Generative AI</li>
  <li>Mixed Attributes/ Multimodal AI</li>
</ul>

#### Teaching
<p>In teaching and supervision, I offer courses and mentors students in AI/ML, Data Mining, Adaptive AI, and Responsible AI. My approach to teaching aligns deeply with the words of Nikos Kazantzakis, who beautifully describes the role of a mentor and educator:
  
<em>"Ideal teachers are those who use themselves as bridges over which they invite their students to cross, then having facilitated their crossing, joyfully collapse, encouraging them to create bridges of their own." </em></p>
