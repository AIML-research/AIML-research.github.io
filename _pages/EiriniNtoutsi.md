<p>Eirini Ntoutsi is a <em>Full Professor for Open Source Intelligence</em> at the University of the Bundeswehr Munich (UniBwM) and the Research Institute CODE. Previously, she was a <em>Full Professor of Artificial Intelligence</em> at the Free University of Berlin (FUB) and an <em>Associate Professor of Intelligent Systems</em> at Leibniz University Hannover (LUH), and she remains a member of the L3S Research Center today. She also held a postdoctoral position at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU). She obtained her Ph.D. from the University of Piraeus, Athens, and holds an M.Sc. and a Diploma in Computer Engineering and Informatics from the University of Patras, Greece.</p>

<p>She specializes in developing intelligent algorithms to tackle <em>real-world challenges</em> like <em>non-stationarity</em>, <em>imbalances</em>, and <em>data scarcity</em>. Committed to <em>responsible AI</em> progress, she focuses on understanding the capabilities and limitations of AI systems by addressing <em>bias and discrimination</em>, enhancing transparency through <em>explainable AI</em>, and strengthening the <em>resilience</em> and <em>robustness</em> of AI/ML models.</p>

Her ultimate goal? <strong>Creating intelligent systems that augment human intelligence and benefit society</strong>.
