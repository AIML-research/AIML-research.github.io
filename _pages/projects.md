## Projects
The AIML group advances the scientific foundations of robust and responsible AI through fundamental and application-oriented research. Our work is implemented and validated through nationally and internationally funded projects in collaboration with academic, governmental, and industrial partners. It is supported by European and national funding agencies, including the European Union, the DFG, the BMBF, and the Volkswagen Foundation.

Our methods are applied across domains such as education, social networks, banking, agriculture, manufacturing, and engineering.

<ul>
  <li><b><a href = "{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/mammoth">MAMMOTH (Multi-Attribute, Multimodal Bias Mitigation in AI Systems)</a></b></li>
Funding: EU under the call HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01 (A HUMAN-CENTRED AND ETHICAL DEVELOPMENT OF DIGITAL AND INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES 2021).<br> 
The MAMMOth project focuses on multi-discrimination mitigation for tabular, network and multimodal data. Through its 
computer science and AI experts, MAMMOth aims at addressing the associated scientific challenges by developing an innovative 
fairness-aware AI-data driven foundation that provides the necessary tools and techniques for the discovery and mitigation of 
(multi-)discrimination and ensures the accountability of AI-systems with respect to multiple protected attributes and for traditional 
tabular data and more complex network and visual data. The project aims to demonstrate through pilots the developed solutions into three relevant sectors of interest: a) finance/loan applications, b) identity verification systems, and c) academic evaluation.

  <li><b><a href = "{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/stelar">STELAR (Spatio-TEmporal Linked data tools for the AgRi-food data space)</a></b></li>
Funding: EU under the call HORIZON-CL4-2021-DATA-01-03 - Technologies for data management (IA).<br> 
  STELAR will design, develop, evaluate, and showcase an innovative Knowledge Lake Management System (KLMS) to support and facilitate a holistic approach for FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and AI-ready (high-quality, reliably labeled) data that will be pilot tested in diverse, real-world use cases in the agrifood data space, one of the nine data spaces of strategic societal and economic importance identified in the European Strategy for Data.

  <li><b><a href = "{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/hephaestus">Hephaestus - Machine learning methods for adaptive process planning of 5-axis milling</a></b></li>
Funding: <a href="https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/424298653" target="_new">DFG</a>.<br>
Rising customer demands and a trend towards smaller batch sizes have led to an increased complexity in product design and subsequent process planning, e.g. of 5-axes milling operations. Thus, process simulations are commonly used in industry to support process planning. Especially, the dimensional accuracy is crucial for most machined parts, since it affects directly the functionality. Consequently, finishing operations have especially high requirements with respect to the surface tolerances. Despite the aforementioned simulation tools, manual adjustments, which rely on the expert knowledge of workers and process planners, are still necessary in order to cope with process- or machine-specific deviations such as tool stiffness or machine dynamics.

  <li><b><a href = "{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/offshore">CRC 1463:  Integrated Design and Operation Methodology for Offshore Megastructures</a></b></li>
Funding: <a href="https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/457016492" target="_new">DFG</a>.<br>
With the help of the real-time capable simulation model of a digital twin, the SFB researches the design and operating conditions of offshore megastructures, whereby all life phases of a structure can be represented. This enables a reactive and automated adaptation of the structure and its operation to current and future conditions.  
We participate in project B01 "Integrated design process for offshore structures" with the aim to develop a prognosis model to predict the design quality over the complete life cycle of offshore structures, combining the experience and intuition of the engineer and expert through appropriate ML methods.

Funding: <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/860630" target="_new">EU</a>.<br>
The core objective of NoBIAS is to research and develop novel methods for AI-based decision making without bias. NoBIAS will deliver a cohort of 15 researchers trained to identify biased and discriminating AI-decision making and able to provide solutions that reconcile and fully exploit AI while ensuring compliance with legal and social norms.

  <li><b><a href = "{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/bias">BIAS – Bias and Discrimination in Big Data and Algorithmic Processing. Philosophical Assessments, Legal Dimensions, and Technical Solutions.</a></b></li>
Funding: <a href="http://portal.volkswagenstiftung.de/search/projectDetails.do?ref=95037" target="_new">Volkswagen Stiftung</a>.<br>
AI techniques based on big data and algorithmic processing are increasingly used to guide decisions in important societal spheres, including hiring decisions, university admissions, loan granting, and crime prediction. However, there are growing concerns with regard to the epistemic and normative quality of AI evaluations and predictions. Our shared research question is: How can standards of unbiased attitudes and non-discriminatory practices be met in big data analysis and algorithm-based decision-making?
In approaching this question, we will provide philosophical analyses of the relevant concepts and principles in the context of AI (bias, discrimination, fairness), investigate their adequate reception in pertinent legal frameworks (data protection, consumer, competition, anti-discrimination law), and develop concrete technical solutions (debiasing strategies, discrimination detection procedures etc.).

AI technologies are the driving force behind digitization. Due to their enormous social relevance, a responsible use of AI is of particular importance. The research and application of responsible AI is a very young discipline and requires the bundling of research activities from different disciplines in order to design and apply AI systems in a reliable, transparent, secure and legally acceptable way.<br>

  <li><b><a href = "{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/oscar">OSCAR - Opinion Stream Classification with Ensembles and Active leaRners</a>.</b></li>
Funding: <a href="https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/317686254?language=en" target="_new">DFG</a>, Role: PI (Eirini Ntoutsi).<br>
Many data accumulating in the Web reflect opinions on diverse subjects - products, institutions, events (e.g., elections) or topics (e.g., earth warming). Opinionated documents constitute a continuous stream; polarity learning on them delivers insights on the attitude of people towards each subject. Polarity learning algorithms must cope with classic Big Data characteristics: high volume and velocity of the arriving data, and volatility of the learned concepts, since subjects and attitudes of people toward certain subjects change over time. In OSCAR, we will develop classifiers that operate on an evolving feature space, adapt to changes in both vocabulary and data and operate with limited class labels.

The project aims at the establishment of an isotopic fingerprint for bioarchaeological finds, especially cremations, and its application to archaeological and cultural-historical problems of the Late Bronze Age until Roman Times. From a computer science persective, our focus is on the development of innovative methods that allow complete scientific analysis of project related data despite their complexity. We focus on data management and automated data analysis (similarity search, cluster analysis, outlier recognition) for the establishment of small-scaled isotopic fingerprints.
