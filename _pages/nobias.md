#### 3. Project overview
<i>The core objective of NoBIAS is to research and develop novel methods for AI-based decision making without bias. NoBIAS will deliver a cohort of 15 researchers trained to identify biased and discriminating AI-decision making and able to provide solutions that reconcile and fully exploit AI while ensuring compliance with legal and social norms. </i>

The interdisciplinary NoBIAS consortium consists of eight organizations including a non-academic one spread across five European states with leading expertise in artificial intelligence, law and sociology. The network is complemented with ten associated non-academic partners from different application domains including banks and healthcare.
