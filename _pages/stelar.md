#### 4. Project overview
STELAR will design, develop, evaluate, and showcase an innovative Knowledge Lake Management System (KLMS) to support and facilitate a holistic approach for FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and AI-ready (high-quality, reliably labeled) data that will be pilot tested in diverse, real-world use cases in the agrifood data space.

<!-- STELAR will design, develop, evaluate, and showcase an innovative Knowledge Lake Management System (KLMS) to support and facilitate a holistic approach for FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and AI-ready (high-quality, reliably labeled) data. The STELAR KLMS will allow to (semi-)automatically turn a raw data lake into a knowledge lake. This is achieved by (1) enhancing the data lake with a knowledge layer, and (2) developing and integrating a set of data management tools and workflows. The knowledge layer will comprise: (a) a data catalog offering automatically enhanced metadata for the raw data assets in the lake, and (b) a knowledge graph that semantically describes and interlinks these data assets using suitable domain ontologies and vocabularies. The provided tools and workflows will offer novel functionalities for: (a) data discovery and quality management; (b) data linking and alignment; and (c) data annotation and synthetic data generation. The KLMS will combine both human-in-the-loop and automatic approaches, to leverage background knowledge of domain experts while minimizing their involvement. To reduce manual effort and time, it will increase the automation of finding and selecting relevant data sources, configuring, and tuning the involved data management tools, and designing, executing, and monitoring end-to-end data processing workflows adapted to different user needs. The KLMS will include specialized tools and functions for geospatial, temporal, and textual data. An organization, ranging from a data-intensive SME to the operator of a data marketplace, will be able to use the STELAR KLMS to increase the readiness of its data assets for use in AI applications and for being shared and exchanged within a common data space. The STELAR KLMS will be pilot tested in diverse, real-world use cases in the agrifood data space, one of the nine data spaces of strategic societal and economic importance identified in the European Strategy for Data.-->

#### 5. Overview of our contributions
we lead WP4: "<i>Tools for AI-ready data</i>" and contributes to other WPs.
Existence of vast amounts of data is required as a supplement of the real data for ML model training and for supporting simulations. The real data and the automatically produced data profiles (correlations, distributions, average values, outliers, etc.) will be used for generating big synthetic data. We will use a combination of available open-source black-box Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and open-box data generators based on the data profiles, to generate data at will. We will also use our own state-of-the-art methods and algorithms for data generation and augmentation, which include work on semi-supervised learning for dealing with label scarcity, synthetic data-augmentation for tackling class-imbalance and unfairness, counterfactual generation for tabular data and textual data and generative models. The focus will be on semi- and self-supervised learning, as well as active learning, involving the domain expert only when necessary. The goal is to generate high utility data rather than just data artifacts. To this end, the generation process will consider the existence of biases and will mitigate their effects. Moreover, the plausibility of the data will be evaluated to ensure that only relevant to the problem at hand instances are considered. XAI techniques will be used to debug and validate model decisions (i.e., annotation/labeling/generation decisions) to ensure that what has been learned is correct and unbiased. Such explanations will increase the trust and confidence of domain experts when putting AI models into production. Finally, the robustness of GANs against adversarial attacks will be considered.
