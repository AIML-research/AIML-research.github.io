The Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) group, lead by Prof. Dr. Eirini Ntoutsi, researches and develops AI that is *technically robust*, resilient to biases, data imbalances, distribution shifts, adversarial attacks, and other real-world challenges, and *societally responsible*, with emphasis on fairness, explainability, and accountability. We also develop generative AI as a tool for improving data quality and creating novel solutions.

Our applications span diverse domains, including education, agriculture, banking, and engineering.

Three fundamental questions drive our work: *How can we build intelligent machines for the real world?* Equally important, *what kind of intelligence do we aspire to build?* And, *can AI exhibit creativity?*

Our ongoing research includes:
- Continuous learning over evolving data and data streams.
- Responsible AI with a focus on fairness-aware machine learning, explainable AI and (adversarial) robustness.
- Generative AI for enhancing data quality for AI and enabling novel solutions.


We are part of [Research Institute CODE for cybersecurity and smart data](https://www.unibw.de/code) and the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.unibw.de/inf) at the [Bundeswehr University Munich (UniBwM)](https://www.unibw.de/). Previously, we have been working at the [Freie Universität Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/en/) and [Leibniz Universität Hannover](https://www.uni-hannover.de/en/)/[L3S Research Center](https://www.l3s.de/en).
