The Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) Lab, lead by Prof. Dr. Eirini Ntoutsi, focuses on researching and developing intelligent algorithms that address *real-world data challenges* and contribute to the overall improvement of the society. Two fundamental questions drive our work: *How can we build intelligent machines for the real world?* Equally important, *what kind of intelligence do we aspire to build?*

Ongoing directions include:
- Continuous learning over evolving data and data streams.
- Responsible AI with a focus on fairness-aware machine learning and explainable AI.
- Generative AI for generating new data and solutions.

Our methods cover a diverse array of application fields, including education, social networks, banks, agriculture, manufacturing, and engineering.

We are part of [Research Institute CODE for cybersecurity and smart data](https://www.unibw.de/code) and the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.unibw.de/inf) at the [Bundeswehr University Munich (UniBwM)](https://www.unibw.de/). Previously, we have been working at the [Freie Universität Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/en/) and [Leibniz Universität Hannover](https://www.uni-hannover.de/en/)/[L3S Research Center](https://www.l3s.de/en).
