The Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) group, led by Prof. Dr. Eirini Ntoutsi, researches and develops robust and responsible Artificial Intelligence for real-world settings.

Our main research focuses are:
- **Robust AI**, i.e., reliability under data biases, distribution shifts, adversarial manipulation, and other real-world challenges.
- **Responsible AI**, including fairness-aware learning and explainable AI (XAI), with a focus on lifecycle-wide analyses and explicitly modeling objectives beyond pure downstream task performance.
- **Generative AI** for improving data quality, addressing data scarcity, and supporting robust learning.

We apply our methods across a wide range of domains, including education, social networks, banking, agriculture, manufacturing, and engineering.

Three fundamental questions drive our work: *How can we build intelligent machines for the real world?* Equally important, *what kind of intelligence do we aspire to build?* And, *can AI exhibit creativity?*

Our group is part of the research institute [Research Institute CODE for cybersecurity and smart data](https://www.unibw.de/code) and the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.unibw.de/inf) at the [Bundeswehr University Munich (UniBwM)](https://www.unibw.de/). Previously, the group was based at the [Freie Universität Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/en/) and [Leibniz Universität Hannover](https://www.uni-hannover.de/en/)/[L3S Research Center](https://www.l3s.de/en).
