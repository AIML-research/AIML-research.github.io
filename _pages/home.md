The Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) group, led by [Prof. Dr. Eirini Ntoutsi](https://aiml-research.github.io/Eirini/), advances research and development in robust and responsible AI systems for real-world challenges.

Our research focuses are:
- **Robust AI**, addressing reliability under data biases, distribution shifts, adversarial manipulation, and other real-world challenges.
- **Responsible AI**, including fairness-aware learning and explainable AI (XAI), with lifecycle-wide analyses and objectives that go beyond pure task performance.
- **Generative AI**, improving data quality, addressing data scarcity, and supporting robust learning.

We apply our methods across domains such as education, social networks, banking, agriculture, manufacturing, and engineering.

Three fundamental questions guide our work:
- How can we build intelligent machines for the real world?
- What kind of intelligence should we aspire to build?
- Can AI exhibit creativity?

The AIML group is based in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.unibw.de/inf) at the [University of the Bundeswehr Munich (UniBwM)](https://www.unibw.de/) and is part of the [Research Institute CODE for Cybersecurity and Smart data](https://www.unibw.de/code). Previously, the group was based at [Freie Universität Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/en/) and [Leibniz Universität Hannover](https://www.uni-hannover.de/en/)/[L3S Research Center](https://www.l3s.de/en).
