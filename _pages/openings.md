## Want to work with us?

### PhD/PostDoc positions
We are looking for talented and highly motivated students from Computer Science or a closely related discipline interested in the research and development of AI/ML methods. The goal of our group can be summarized as designing intelligent algorithms that learn from data continuously following the cumulative nature of human learning, while ensuring that what has been learned helps driving positive societal impact. 
Our current offerings focus on the following topics:
<ul>
  <li>Adaptive learning/ continual learning</li>
  <li>Responsible AI (esp. fairness-aware learning, xAI, resilient-ML)</li>
  <li>Generative AI (esp. for temporal data, image data, graphs)</li>
</ul>

**Candidate profile**
<ul>
<li>Strong background in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining techniques.</li>
<li>Strong programming skills (preferably Python)</li>
<li>Very good knowledge of AI frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras</li>
<li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills in English</li>
<li>Knowledge of German is a plus, but is not obligatory. </li>
<li>Critical thinking, quality-oriented and independent work, professional commitment.</li>
<li>Willingness to learn, creative and cooperative.</li>
</ul>
  
For further information, contact Prof. Dr. Eirini Ntoutsi (eirini.ntoutsi@fu-berlin.de), with subject ``PhD/Postdoc Application". 

**How to apply?**
Please send your application (as a single pdf file) to Prof. Dr. Eirini Ntoutsi (eirini.ntoutsi@unibw.de) with subject “PhD application” or “PostDoc application”. The application should include a brief motivation letter, a CV, copies of certificates including transcripts of your grades, a summary of your bachelor and master thesis, list of publications (if available) and list of referees (name and contact details). Applications will be considered as they are received and until the positions are filled.
