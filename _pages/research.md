# Research

Our research lies in the areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Our goal is to design intelligent algorithms that learn from data continuously following the cumulative nature of human learning, while ensuring that what has been learned is not only correct but also delivers positive social impact in accordance with ethical and legal requirements.

We currently focus on the following directions:

- Continuous learning over non-stationary data and data streams, that is adapting machine learning models to changing environments.
- Responsible AI, in particular fairness-aware machine learning and explainable AI.
- Creative AI, that is using machines to generate new data and solutions.
